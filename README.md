This homework was pretty challenging and tedious. It would take me a long time to get one output that I wanted. 

Learning to manipualte the charts and data was both challenging and helpful in understanding what the statistical values mean. 

Three pieces of information gleaned from this analysis are: 

1. The two most commonly tested Drug Regimens were Capomulin and Ramicane. 
2. There were slightly more male mice tested than females. Slightly here means 1.4% more male mice than female mice. 
3. The largest tumor volume was for the Infubinol regimen likely meaning this drug was not successful in making the tumors smaller.
